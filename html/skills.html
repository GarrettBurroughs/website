                        As an experience Java developer, I am well versed in the concepts and intracies of advanced
                        Java programs. With 5 years of applied java development with respect to robotics and computer
                        applications,
                        I am confident in tackling programming tasks of almost any size. I am the main developer and
                        maintainer of the

                    <p>
                        Part of my passion and talent comes in designing and creating larger scale frameworks with
                        highly customizeable and
                        reuseable code, as well as creating extensive documentation, that is ideal for working in a team
                        enviornent.
                        I also have experience with multiple different build systems, such as ant, maven, and gradle.

                        As a javascript developer, I have written both frontend and backend applications. I am familiar
                        with all elements of the stack, including:
                        React, Vue, Express, Node, MongoDB, MySQL and SQLite. As well as other javascript libraries for
                        frontent and backend development. Although I am
                        comfortable developing the full stack, my knowledge, experitise and ability mostly lies in the
                        server side, handling logic and data management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have used multiple npm libraries to make unique applications such as discord, slack, and irc
                        chatbots, and server managemenet software.
                        I am also comfortable with the different flavours of javascript such as TypeScript, ES2015 and
                        JSX, and always adapting to new trends.

                        Although my forte lies in the backend and logical side of programming, I am also able to create
                        thoughtful design through HTML and CSS.
                        I am also comfortable manipulating css and html elements through the DOM to create reactive
                        websites. My work with CSS and HTML is mainly centered
                        on formatting data coming from the backend. I can also make a website from a given design.

                        As an intermediate python developer, I am well versed in using python for research purposes,
                        such as simulations,
                        machine learning, neural networks, and large data processing. I am also able to tackle computing
                        and life tasks with
                        simple python scripts.

                        I also have experience teaching python in a one on one and class enviornment.

                        and
                        teaching robotics and engineering concepts. I have also scored a 5 on both the BC calculus exam
                        and AP Physic C exams,
                        and am able to apply physics and calculus to engineering design and implementation

                        I have also written code to control robotic devices, and specialize in control theory and
                        automation, having a
                        deep interest in cyber-mechanical systems.
